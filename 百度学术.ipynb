      "In the past ten years,the ideas and activities on cross-border education were concerned. By reviewing foreign literatures,it is found that the term of cross-border education is widely used since 2003. Foreign scholars have conducted extensive studies on problems in this area,such as its concept,its motivation,its subject,relationship between cross-border education and GATS,and its impact on education systems around the world. Because profit is the primary purpose and people need to pay high tuition,and therefore cross-border education can not improve the student enrollment opportunities in host country significantly,the impact on the local education system is very limited. The studies also showed that in most of the countries or areas,quality assurance system has not been established or improved,quality certification capacity of existing institutions for cross-border education is very limited,the quality of the current cross-border education is worrying.\n",

      "This paper analyzes the specific features of academic honesty in cross-border degree education between Finland and Russia, as seen by students involved in this process. We collected valuable information concerning particular cases of dishonesty as well as some relevant system-level data by doing a Web-based survey. The survey was carried out on our own freshmen and advanced students and on our distance students in Russia. This research was primarily quantitatively oriented, and we used several independent techniques to discover significant dependencies in the feedback provided. The results clearly show the students interest in the topic itself and the evident existence of culture-dependant honesty issues, which cannot be underestimated in the case of a long-term educational partnership.\n",
